# ðŸ‚¡ Blackjack Reinforcement Learning

This project implements various reinforcement learning algorithms to train an agent to play Blackjack optimally. The goal is to explore and compare different RL techniques in the context of the classic card game.

## ðŸ“– Overview

Blackjack is a popular casino card game where the objective is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding 21. This project models Blackjack as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and applies reinforcement learning algorithms to learn optimal strategies.

## ðŸ§  Implemented Algorithms

- **Monte Carlo Methods**: Learn value functions and policies based on averaging sample returns.
- **Temporal Difference (TD) Learning**: Learn directly from raw experience without a model of the environment's dynamics.
