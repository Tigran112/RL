# ‚ôæÔ∏è Infinite Variance ‚Äì Exploring Variance in Monte Carlo Estimators

This project investigates the phenomenon of infinite variance in Monte Carlo estimators within reinforcement learning contexts. It replicates and visualizes examples from Sutton & Barto‚Äôs *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*, highlighting how certain sampling methods can lead to estimators with infinite variance, thereby affecting the stability and reliability of learning algorithms.

## üìñ Overview

Monte Carlo methods are widely used for estimating value functions in reinforcement learning. However, under specific conditions, these estimators can exhibit infinite variance, leading to unstable learning and poor convergence. This project:

- Reproduces key examples demonstrating infinite variance in Monte Carlo estimators.
- Visualizes the behavior of these estimators through plots and simulations.
- Provides insights into the causes and implications of infinite variance in reinforcement learning.
